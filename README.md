# MissSpelledWodsCorrecting
This Project is to find corrrect word for generally misspelled word. The corpus is taken from Birkbeck spelling error corpus which contains misspelled words and correct words. We used MED (Minimum Edit Distance) to find the cost to convert one strig to another. You need to run Assignment1.py ad run each cell to reproduce the same results. Corpus file named as Brikbeck.txt is also included in this project.
The corpus comprises over 43,000 words, which, based on our estimations, would require over 15 hours for execution. Due to resource constraints, we have opted to focus on the top 500 words from the corpus and computed our average success values within this subset.
Included in the project is the original dataset, denoted as "Birkbeck.txt," representing the entire corpus. Additionally, we utilized a subset from this original dataset, referred to as "Birkbeck_Subset.txt."
